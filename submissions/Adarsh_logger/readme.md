This project contains a Python-based **keylogger and screenshot logger**, designed for use in **ethical red team testing**. It logs keystrokes, captures active window titles, and optionally sends logs to a **Discord webhook** at a fixed interval.

Combined with a **USB Rubber Ducky / Flipper Zero** Ducky Script, it simulates a keystroke injection attack to deploy and execute the payload silently.
