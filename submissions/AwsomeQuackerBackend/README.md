## Discord Backend
This repo includes a hackDucky script that installs a Python executable which sends system info to a Discord webhook on startup.
The file also allows the user to control the computer remotely. They can take screenshot (!screenshot), kill the program (!kill), view and take files (!list_files <path>, !get_file <path>)
and clear the channel to hide sensitive info during testing (!purge_channel).

## Setup
1. Update the download link in the Ducky script to point to your Python executable.
2. Copy the updated Ducky script to your HackDucky SD card.
3. Create a `.env` file in the same folder as your Python script with the following content
    ```
    URL="your_discord_webhook_url_here"
    ```
4. Add your bot token to the .env or hardcode it in (for exe EXPOSES TOKEN)
5. Run or deploy the Python executable on the target machine.
6. When the executable runs, it will collect system information and send it to the Discord webhook URL defined in `.env`.

## How to prevent.

While Windows Defender will block programs similar to this in many cases.
**PLEASE** keep your computers safe. If you see any USBs that are not yours REMOVE THEM.
Be careful of public computers (free public libraries, makerspaces, etc.) as they can be easily
infected with keyloggers etc. In general avoid any sus :amoug_us: links.
